#' mop: Mobility Oriented-Parity Metric
#'
#' @description
#' mop is a set of tools to perform the Mobility Oriented-Parity metric which
#' helps to compare a set of conditions of reference versus another set of
#' conditions of interest. The main goal is to explore conditions in the set of
#' interest that are non-analogous to those in the reference set.
#'
#' @details
#' To detect levels of dissimilarity between a set of
#' conditions of reference and another set of conditions of interest. The
#' tools included here also help to identify conditions outside rages of the
#' reference set with high detail.
